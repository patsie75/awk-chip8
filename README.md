CHIP-8 emulator in gawk

Requirements: gawk 5.0.1 or higher and the gawk 'time' plugin (part of the ubuntu gawk package)  

Some chill weekend in late december (why do I always have these ideas around the holidays?) I thought I'd like to build an emulator of sorts, since I never have before. The simplest one and highly recommended, was the CHIP-8. Low-res monochrome display, minimum spec hardware and only 36 opcodes. That sounds like my kinda project.  

So a weekend later I had a working example and this is the result.  

It's currently still very basic and lacks any keyboard input, but I hope that will be added soon enough(tm).  

Here's an example running slow-step: https://youtu.be/uxXiSEGi6wQ
