CHIP-8 emulator in gawk

Some chill weekend in late december (why do I always have these ideas around the holidays?) I thought I'd like to build an emulator of sorts, since I never have before. The simplest one and highly recommended, was the CHIP-8. Low-res monochrome display, minimum spec hardware and only 36 opcodes. That sounds like my kinda project.  

So a weekend later I had a working example and this is the result.  

It's currently still very basic and lacks any keyboard input or timer support, but I hope that will be added soon enough(tm).
